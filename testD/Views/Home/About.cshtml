    <p>MELBOURNE, Australia — On Little Bourke Street in Melbourne’s central business district, a subway-like tunnel leads into a polished concrete shrine to one of the most coveted products in modern luxury menswear. Inside, on shiny illuminated shelves outfitted with digital displays, the walls are dripping with hundreds of pairs of sneakers from Balenciaga, Rick Owens, Pierre Hardy, Raf Simons, Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Lanvin, Kris van Assche, Maison Martin Margiela, Christopher Kane, Giuseppe Zanotti and others, as well as special lines, limited-edition collections, collaborations and pre-releases by Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Diemme, Common Projects and Boris Bidjan Saberi.

This high-tech retail temple, named Sneaker Man, is the brainchild of Chris Kyvetos, 30, former creative director and buyer at Australian men’s department store Harrolds and a long-time sneaker enthusiast, whose carefully laid plans to target a rapidly emerging generation of luxury consumers with an offering focused on trainers were lent credence, late last year, when Balenciaga announced the appointment of its new designer, Alexander Wang.</p>
